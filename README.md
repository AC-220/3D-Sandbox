The link above will display the code and will allow it to be run and its functions to be interactable.

The project creates a 3D environment with various shapes, whose properties can be controlled and altered by the user. This project has multiple features that utilise the keyboard inputs. For example "r" resets the environment, "s" stops the shapes from rotating and resumes them on a second press of the button. There is a fullscreen mode, accessed by toggling the "f" key. A dark mode feature was implemented is a button that toggles the background of the environment to turn a dark grey.

 Moving the right slider will change the size of the object, and the left slider will change the lighting of the environment. Toggling the "n" key will rotate the focus between the different objects, the focus is then subject to changes by the right slider etc.
